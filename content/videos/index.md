### OpenStack Summit 2014 Paris

I attended as speaker in the OpenStack Summit 2014 in Paris. We talked about how we designed the deployment of OpenStack in the spanish bank BBVA, based on Red Hat OpenStack and Nuage SDN. In the talk I explained the integration of Nuage in the OpenStack, and how we replaced Neutron (you can find it in the minute 20 of the video).
