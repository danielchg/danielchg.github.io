Iâ€™m an open source enthusiast with more than 20 years of experience working with Linux. In the last years I have been focusing on DevOps for Artificial Intelligence based on Kubernetes. 

Currently I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat, within the Telco 5G area, where I'm working on integrations of OpenShift for the Telco 5G partners.
